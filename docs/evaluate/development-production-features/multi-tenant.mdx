Temporal Cloud's architecture scales to handle multiple tenants efficiently.
Our features enable you to handle multiple Namespaces sharing the same compute and persistence layer, ensuring performance and operational efficiency.
A Namespace is a unit of isolation within the Temporal Platform.
A single Namespace is still multi-tenant.
Customers pay for consumption instead of entire sets of hardware, providing a cost-effective solution.

Multi-tenancy ensures extra capacity is available for all customers during traffic spikes.
However, multi-tenancy also presents the challenge of noisy neighbors, where high-traffic tenants consume excess resources, causing slower performance for other tenants.
The noisy neighbor problem is particularly difficult to address in the database, which is stateful and takes longer to scale.
Temporal's write-heavy workload, where changes in execution state are constantly written to the persistence layer, demands a database that supports reliably high throughput with low latency for multiple customers, concurrently and fairly.
